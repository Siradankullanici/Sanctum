/// The CommandRequest is the inbound (GUI to engine) request for the engine to perform some form of work.
/// This contains the command in question as a String, and 'args' which is a generic JSON serialised "Value"
/// from Serde which allows the struct to contain any number of arguments, serialised to / from a struct that
/// is appropriate for the calling / receiving functions.
///
/// # Sending function
///
/// The sending function must encode data like so:
///
/// ## No data to send:
///
/// ```ignore
/// // where IPC is of type IpcClient as implemented in the GUI.
/// ipc.send_ipc::<(), Option<Value>>("scanner_cancel_scan", None).await
/// ```
///
/// ## Data of type A to send:
///
/// ```ignore
/// let path = to_value(vec![PathBuf::from(file_path)]).unwrap();
/// ipc.send_ipc::<FileScannerState, _>("scanner_start_folder_scan", Some(path)).await
/// ```
